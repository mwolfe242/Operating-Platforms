# Operating-Platforms

**Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**

The Gaming Room client is a group that wished for us to design web based game based on their android game called Draw It or Lose It. They had a few requests for the game. They wanted it to be supported on multiple platforms, the game had to have the ability to have one or more teams involved, each team had to have multiple players, the game and teams had to be unique, and only one game instance can exist in memory at a given time.

**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**

I believe I properly documented the requests that the client had made as well as revising the documentation along the way.

**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**

I believe that working with the documentation helped me gain a more thorough understanding on the requirements of the program and everyhting involved. I believe this lead me to create an all around better product as well as grow in knowledge as a developer.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

With the ability to go back and revise things in my documentation I believe I would only change how some things are worded and how well I articulated my thoughts. I find it hard to put my thoughts on paper in a way that truly demonstrates what I wanted to get across.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

I tried my best to do as little interpreting as possible. My goal was to understand exactly what was asked and deliver it in a way that the user wanted. I went through the requests one by one and implemented them in the program to the best of my ability. The documentation was a help in keeping me on track and not straying from the requests of the client.

**How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**

I have never developed the habbit of documenting before programming, which I have learned now was a mistake. The record of requirements and plans along the way help keep me grounded and I dont have to worry about losing track of a request or forgetting a conversation. I want to keep up with this practice in my future development to ensure I not only am a good programmer, but also a good team member to whoever I am working with.
